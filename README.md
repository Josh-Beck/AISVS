## Introduction

The Artificial Intelligence Security Verification Standard (AISVS) focuses on providing developers, architects, and security professionals with a structured security checklist to evaluate and verify the security and ethical considerations of AI-driven applications. Modeled after existing OWASP standards (such as the ASVS for web applications), AISVS will define categories of requirements for areas including:

* Training Data Governance & Bias Management
* User Input Validation
* Model Lifecycle Management & Change Control
* Infrastructure, Configuration & Deployment Security
* Access Control & Identity for AI Components & Users
* Supply Chain Security for Models, Frameworks & Data
* Model Behavior, Output Control & Safety Assurance
* Memory, Embeddings & Vector Database Security
* Autonomous Orchestration & Agentic Action Security
* Adversarial Robustness & Attack Resistance
* Privacy Protection & Personal Data Management
* Monitoring, Logging & Anomaly Detection
* Human Oversight, Accountability & Governance
* Explainability, Interpretability & Transparency
