## Introduction

The Artificial Intelligence Security Verification Standard (AISVS) focuses on providing developers, architects, and security professionals with a structured checklist to evaluate and verify the security and ethical considerations of AI-driven applications. Modeled after existing OWASP standards (such as the ASVS for web applications), AISVS will define categories of requirements for areas including:

1. Training Data Governance & Bias Management
2. User Input Validation
3. Model Lifecycle Management & Change Control
4. Infrastructure, Configuration & Deployment Security
5. Access Control & Identity
6. Supply Chain Security for Models, Frameworks & Data
7. Model Behavior, Output Control & Safety Assurance
8. Memory, Embeddings & Vector Database Security
9. Autonomous Orchestration & Agentic Action Security
10. Adversarial Robustness & Attack Resistance
11. Privacy Protection & Personal Data Management
12. Monitoring, Logging & Anomaly Detection
13. Human Oversight and Trust
