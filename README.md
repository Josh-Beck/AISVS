## Introduction

The Artificial Intelligence Security Verification Standard (AISVS) focuses on providing developers, architects, and security professionals with a structured security checklist to evaluate and verify the security and ethical considerations of AI-driven applications. Modeled after existing OWASP standards (such as the ASVS for web applications), AISVS will define categories of requirements for areas including:

* Data Integrity and Privacy: Ensuring the integrity of training data, verifying minimal and privacy-respecting data collection, and monitoring for data poisoning or bias.
* Model Security: Guidance on tampering resistance, distribution of models, and policy enforcement.
* Model Explainability and Transparency: Requirements that encourage interpretability and accountability.
* Infrastructure and Deployment Security: Verification of containerization, cloud security, and code dependencies.
* Ethical and Compliance Considerations: Requirements for fairness, bias mitigation, and regulatory compliance where applicable.
