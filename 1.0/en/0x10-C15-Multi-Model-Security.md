# C15 Multi-Model System Security

## Control Objective

Systems using multiple AI models must implement security controls for model-to-model communication, shared resources, ensemble decision-making, and model pipeline integrity. These controls prevent cross-model attacks, data leakage, and ensure secure coordination between AI components.
